Ishuah Kariuki is a husband, father, software engineer, and SRE. He graduated from Kenyatta University in 2011 with a BSc. in Computer Science. He's worked with several startups in the Kenyan tech ecosystem and currently works as a Software Engineer II at **Microsoft**.

Ishuah prefers the short form moniker "Ish" when he's out and about being an untenable troublemaker. He's available for any activity that involves laughter and adrenaline.

Ish is tired of referring to himself in the third person. You can follow his shenanigans on Twitter [@ishuah\_](https://twitter.com/ishuah_) or contact him by email at [kariuki@ishuah.com](mailto:kariuki@ishuah.com).
