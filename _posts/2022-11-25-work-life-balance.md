I thought I knew what work-life balance meant. I was a happy-go-lucky bachelor with very little care in the world. I could stay up late, finish a week's worth of work and then run to the nearest beach to enjoy life. I dedicated months to purely training for half marathons and climbed Kilimanjaro twice, once on a whim.

Then there was a lull when the pandemic hit. The world slowed down, and my anxiety powered up. 2020 was a very introspective year. I started therapy, and while on this journey, I realized that I wasn't enjoying life. I was drinking more and adventuring less. Work was going great, but life suffered.

2021 was a better year. I landed a new job, had several public speaking opportunities, and life was getting more satisfactory. The most memorable event, I sent a text that changed my life.

> "Do you want to grab a coffee sometime?"

I distinctly remember that we didn't drink coffee. I drank beer, craft beer. My date, Mel, had wine by the glass. There was live music, and we danced. Later that night, Mel texted me.

> "I enjoyed the laughs. Now you need to divulge the agenda."

I trembled a bit as I wrote my reply. Maybe it was the craft beer. I've known Mel since 2018; we were colleagues once. We lost touch over the years, but we started talking in mid-2021. Out of the blue, I asked her out with no clear agenda. My ancestors must have been very worried about their lineage.

And that was the beginning of a life-changing experience. Mel reminded me about my passions in life. A few months after we started dating, she got me guitar lessons after I mentioned how I'd love to learn how to play the guitar. I played for three months and even learned how to tune a guitar. But I'm no Fancy Fingers, so I'm more careful about what I wish for around Mel. 

On the last weekend of January 2022, Mel and I attended Fancy Finger's concert at The Alchemist. We stayed till the end because we wanted to dance to our favorite song, Daddy Issues.

> "I'm about to be a father, na siko ready."

I remember this night because we found out we were pregnant the very next day. We were scared, happy, shocked, joyful, a blend of emotions. We made our decision.

Seven months, twenty-two days later, we welcomed Mansa to the world. That was the most life-changing of all my life-changing moments. Life became fuller. In those seven months, I proposed, and we built a home. We didn't do it alone. I'm grateful for the support structure we have. My mum bought a shipment of baby clothes that will last till Mansa is 5. My mother-in-law traveled eight hours to see her granddaughter as soon as she was born. My father, always with a somber expression, speaks fatherly advice. I cannot fail to mention Esther, my cousin, and our doula. She labored with Mel, taught me how to bathe my daughter, and is always a phone call away when we have questions.

This essay started with a purpose, but, like every conversation, I ended up talking about my daughter. 

So, what is work-life balance? When you can give your best at work without missing important moments of your life.

Love you, Mel & Mansa.
